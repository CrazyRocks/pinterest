# Pinterest
A PHP class for interfacing with Pinterest's private API

Note: I enjoy making things hard for people, so I'm not going to tell you how to use this in detail. Just instantiate the class object, assign the tokens/username/email/whatever other credentials you want, sign in, and start making API calls.
